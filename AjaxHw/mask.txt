<p id="verse1">We wear the mask that grins and lies,<br>
It hides our cheeks and shades our eyes,â€”<br>
This debt we pay to human guile;<br>
With torn and bleeding hearts we smile,<br>
And mouth with myriad subtleties.<br></p>

<p id="verse2">Why should the world be over-wise,<br>
In counting all our tears and sighs?<br>
Nay, let them only see us, while<br>
We wear the mask.</p>

<p id="verse3">We smile, but, O great Christ, our cries<br>
To thee from tortured souls arise.<br>
We sing, but oh the clay is vile<br>
Beneath our feet, and long the mile;<br>
But let the world dream otherwise,<br>
We wear the mask!<br></p>
