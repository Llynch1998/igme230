        <p id="about">Hello! I'm Wyatt Lynch and I am a New Media Interactive Development Major at RIT. As a New Media Interactive Major, I'm constantly trying to create new and interesting projects to play with. With my time at RIT,, I've learned a lot about the principles of design, in addition to Javascript, C#, and some html and CSS. However, before my time at RIT, I attended a Community College called TC3. There, I obtained an Associates of Science in New Media. This degree included everything from charcoal drawings to game design and animation. A lot of my experience from TC3 shapes my work to this day, as I am always looking for a new way to do something different.</p>
